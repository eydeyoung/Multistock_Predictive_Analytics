# Multistock Predictive Analytics

In this project, extending a case study by Tatsat, the price data for multiple stocks (GE and MMM) are combined with ticker data and currency data and used to generate features for weekly stock return forecasting.
Multiple time series and sequential regression models are generated and daisy chaining applied in order to use the predictions of one stock as an input to another. AlphaLens tears are used for the evaluation of the
selected model in order to analyze the use of predictions as a factor in trading strategies.
